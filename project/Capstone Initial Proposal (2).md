# Capstone Project Plan
_Please enter your project information below for your capstone project idea and your plan for completion_

# Outline
#### Basic Description of your project/idea
- The project is to create a Tetris-like game in Java. Blocks of 
different shapes will fall from the top, and the player will move them left, 
right, or down to fit them into rows. If a row is full, it will disappear.

#### Additional Details, how you envision it working, important notes to consider, etc...
- The game will have a grid (like a board) where blocks can stack up.
The blocks will stop moving when they touch the bottom or other blocks.
The player earns points by clearing rows.
The game ends when blocks stack to the top of the grid.


#### Features we MUST include
- A simple grid where blocks can move and stack.
Basic movement for blocks (left, right, down).
Rows disappear when they are full.
A simple scoring system.

#### Feature we would like to include
- The ability to rotate blocks (optional).
A message saying “Game Over” when the game ends.


#### How will you incoporate each of the following:
**Module 1 - Variables and Output**
- Variables will keep track of the score, the grid,
 and whether the game is over. Output will display the grid and the score.
**Module 2 - Object Orientation and Inputs**
- Blocks will be objects. Inputs from the keyboard will move the blocks.
**Module 3 - Math, Returns, and/or Constructors**
- Simple math will be used to move blocks on the grid. 
Constructors will create the blocks and the grid.
**Module 4/5 - Conditionals and Loops**
- Loops will move the blocks down over time. Conditionals 
will check if blocks touch the bottom or other blocks, and if rows are full.
**Module 6/7 - Arrays OR ArrayLists**
- A 2D array will be used to represent the grid and check where blocks are.
**Module 8 - Optional: 2D Arrays**
-  The grid will be made using a 2D array.

#### Language, Code, Platform you plan to use?
- Java with basic tools like Visual Studio Code

#### Basic idea of split of work? Tasks assigned to each ohter?
-  We will work together to make the grid and move blocks.
Focus on making it simple and functional.
